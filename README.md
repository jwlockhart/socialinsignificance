# Social (In)Significance
This repo contains the code for a not-so-secret web project of mine. It's in the very early stages as I teach myself `JavaScript` and `D3.js`, and attempt to remember `CSS`, `HTML`, and `PHP`. Yes, this would best be done using a `python` & `mongodb`. Sadly, I want this to be able to run on hosting that doesn't support those things. 

The live version that I'm tinkering with can be found here: http://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~lockhart/test/socialinsignificance/
